Scd and it's types- SCD stands for Slowly Changing Dimension. SCD refers to how dimensional data (e.g., customer information, product details) changes over time and how these changes are managed within a data warehouse or database.
Change data capture - Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technology used in databases and data integration processes to capture and track changes made to data.
Type 1 - Overwrite/Update:

Description: In Type 1 SCD, the old data is simply overwritten with the new data.
Characteristic: No history is maintained; the dimension attribute is updated directly.
Use Case: Appropriate when historical data is not needed or when changes are insignificant.
Example: If a customer changes their phone number, the existing record is updated with the new phone number, and the old one is lost.

Type 2 - Add New Row/Versioning:

Description: In Type 2 SCD, a new row is added to the dimension table to represent the new data, while the old row(s) are retained to maintain history.
Characteristic: Historical records are preserved by creating new records with a new surrogate key (usually a unique identifier).
Use Case: Suitable when you need to keep track of historical changes and analyze data over time.
Example: When a product's price changes, a new record is inserted with the updated price and an incremented version number or effective date.

Type 3 - Add New Attribute:

Description: In Type 3 SCD, a limited history is maintained by adding new columns (attributes) to the existing dimension table to store specific changes.
Characteristic: Unlike Type 2, only selected attributes are kept as history; other attributes remain overwritten.
Use Case: Useful when you want to maintain some historical data but not the full history.
Example: Keeping track of a customer's current and previous addresses in separate columns within the same record.

Coding
1) top 5 customers who have highest avg order amount, considering only customers who made more than 10 orders
2) pandas prog to list of animals weighing more than 100 kg order in desc order

import pandas as pd

# Sample data (assuming you have a DataFrame named 'animals' with columns 'animal' and 'weight_kg')
data = {
    'animal': ['Elephant', 'Giraffe', 'Lion', 'Tiger', 'Zebra'],
    'weight_kg': [500, 800, 200, 150, 120]
}

# Create a DataFrame
animals = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Filter animals weighing more than 100 kg
heavy_animals = animals[animals['weight_kg'] > 100]

# Sort by weight in descending order
heavy_animals_sorted = heavy_animals.sort_values(by='weight_kg', ascending=False)

# Extract the list of animals
list_of_animals = heavy_animals_sorted['animal'].tolist()

3) flatten nested dictionary
1. Maximum count of vowels in a substring of given length. Leetcode problem. 
2. Sql query to find the top 5 products as per their total sales.
3. Catalyst optimiser in spark
